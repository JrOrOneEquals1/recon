# About this tool
This tool uses Python Selenium to parse through certain sites and retrieve IP addresses, emails, and leaks.  It was developed by Cameron Roberts, age 16, and is the son of Carrie and Darin Roberts.

## Information
You need to have Mozilla Firefox installed.  Your usernames and passwords are used only for logging in to the sites that you request to get the information that you request, only when you request it.

# Installation and usage
To install and use this tool, download the recon.exe, recon.config, and the geckodriver.exe (you only need geckodriver and recon.config once) and make sure that they are always in the same folder, or it will not work.  

## Entering credentials
In recon.config, put the necessary credentials in where it tells you to, and put only the credentials in.  You can add extra lines for information about what goes where, but the first four lines should be only your credentials.  

## Changing default settings
To change the default settings, choose the settings you want, and when it asks if you want to save the settings, say yes, then name it 'default'.
