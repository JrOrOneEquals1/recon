This tool uses Python Selenium to parse through certain sites and retrieving IP addresses, emails, and leaks.  It was developed by Cameron Roberts, age 16, and is the son to Carrie and Darin Roberts.

You need to have Mozilla Firefox installed.  Your usernames and passwords are used only for logging in to the sites that you request to get the information that you request, only when you request it.

To install and use this tool, download the recon.exe, recon.config, and the geckodriver.exe (you only need geckodriver once) and make sure that they are always in the same folder, or it will not work.  In recon.config, put the necessary credentials in where it tells you to, and put only the credentials in.  You can add extra lines for information about what goes where, but the first four lines should be only your credentials.
